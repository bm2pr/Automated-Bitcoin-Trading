# Robinhood Bitcoin Automatic Trading Algorithm  

Automatically buys and sells bitcoin on *Robinhood*  

*Robinhood* does not have a public API, so this program opens up a webbrowser and automatically buys and sells on the *Robinhood* website  

Robinhood was chosen due to no fees when making trades  

## Config.py
This program requires a Config.py in order to enter your *Robinhood* login information, as well to find the path to the Chrome Driver executable  
```
# Config.py
USERNAME=''
PASSWORD=''
PATH=r''
```
